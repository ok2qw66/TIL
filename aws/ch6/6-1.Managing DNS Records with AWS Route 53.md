## Introduction

In this hands-on lab, we will learn how to create and manage DNS records inside of Route 53. We'll start by creating a simple application — which will serve as a test website — from two EC2 instances and route traffic using an Application Load Balancer. After this, we will create two records inside a Route 53 hosted zone that will configure the DNS settings for a custom domain and point it to your application.

We'll also look at how DNS works in this scenario (and in general) and how a command line utility like `dig` can get us more information about a domain. These skills will allow us to associate many kinds of AWS web applications with recognizable web domains such as *yourcoolsite.com*.

## Creating EC2 Instances and an Application Load Balancer

If you haven't already done so, log in to the live environment as `cloud_user` with the password provided.

The first thing we're going to do is launch two instances.

### Create the First EC2 Instance

In the AWS Management Console, navigate to EC2 via **Services** at the top. Click **Launch Instance**.

On the AMI page, select **Amazon Linux AMI** (*not* the Amazon Linux 2 AMI).

Next, select **General purpose t2.micro** from the list of instance types, and click **Next: Configure Instance Details**.

We'll leave *Network* as the default VPC. Under *Subnet*, select **us-east-1e**. For *Auto-assign Public IP*, select **Enable**. Before we move on, we need to write a user data script that will install and start a web server on the EC2 instances. To do this, go to the *Advanced Details* section at the bottom, and paste the following code snippet into the *User data* box:

```
#!/bin/bash
yum update -y
yum install -y httpd
cp /usr/share/httpd/noindex/index.html /var/www/html/index.html
service httpd start
```

Click **Next: Add Storage**.

We can leave the default settings here — the *Size (GiB)* should be **8GB** and the *Volume Type* should be **General Purpose SSD (gp2)**. Click **Next: Add Tags**.

Leave all the tag settings on this page (there shouldn't be any tags set), and click **Next: Configure Security Group**.

On the *Configure Security Group* page, we can leave the default **Create a new security group** setting under *Assign a security group*. Under *Security group name*, type "SG". Click **Add Rule** below, and then click the dropdown and select **HTTP**. We can leave the default settings that autopopulate for *Protocol* (TCP), *Port Range* (80), and *Source* (0.0.0.0/0, ::/0). Click **Review and Launch**.

We're going to get a warning at the top that our security group is wide open to the entire internet, but that's fine for this lab environment. In a real-world setting, we'd want to tighten it up.

Everything else should look good, so click **Launch**.

The final step is to create a key pair so we can use SSH to log in to the instance using a key pair. In the *Select an existing key pair or create a new key pair* pop-up, click the default **Choose an existing key pair** to open the dropdown, and select **Create a new key pair**. In *Key pair name*, enter "R53KP" and click **Download Key Pair**. Click **Launch Instances**.

On the *Launch Status* page, click **View Instances**.

Here, we'll see the status is *pending*. It may take a few minutes before it changes to *running*. While we're waiting, let's make our second instance.

### Create the Second EC2 Instance

Navigate back to EC2 via **Services** at the top, and click **Launch Instance**.

On the AMI page, select the same **Amazon Linux AMI** again.

Next, select **General purpose t2.micro**, and click **Next: Configure Instance Details**.

We'll leave *Network* as the default VPC again. But this time, for *Subnet*, select **us-east-1d**. For *Auto-assign Public IP*, select **Enable**. Go to the *Advanced Details* section, and paste the following code snippet into the *User data* box:

```
#!/bin/bash
yum update -y
yum install -y httpd
cp /usr/share/httpd/noindex/index.html /var/www/html/index.html
service httpd start
```

Click **Next: Add Storage**.

We can leave the default settings again, so just click **Next: Add Tags**.

Leave all the tag settings on this page, and click **Next: Configure Security Group**.

This time, on the *Configure Security Group* page, we want to **Select an existing security group** under *Assign a security group*, and then check the box next to our *SG* security group we created a few minutes ago. Click **Review and Launch**.

Everything should be fine, so click **Launch**.

In the *Select an existing key pair or create a new key pair* pop-up, leave the default **Choose an existing key pair**, which should already have our **R53KP** set. Check the box to acknowledge we have access to the selected private key file, and click **Launch Instances**.

On the *Launch Status* page, click **View Instances**.

On the instances page, by now our first instance should have a status of *running*, and the one we just created is most likely *pending*.

In the *IPv4 Public IP* column, copy the IP address listed for the instance that's running. Paste it into a new browser tab, which should bring up an *Amazon Linux AMI Test Page*.

### Create the Application Load Balancer

Back in the EC2 console, click **Load Balancers** in the sidebar (under *LOAD BALANCING*). Click **Create Load Balancer**.

Elastic load balancing supports three types of load balancers: Application Load Balancers, Network Load Balancers, and Classic Load Balancers (which are slowly being phased out).

For this lab, we need an Application Load Balancer, so in the *Application Load Balancer* section, click **Create**.

In the *Basic Configuration* section, give it a *Name* of "ELB" (for "Elastic Load Balancer"), make sure *Scheme* is set to **internet-facing**, and set *IP address type* to **ipv4**. Leave the defaults in the *Listeners* section. For *Availability Zones*, check both **us-east-1d** and **us-east-1e**. Click **Next: Configure Security Settings**.

We aren't using HTTPS, so we don't have to do anything on the security settings page. Click **Next: Configure Security Groups**.

For *Assign a security group*, select **Create a new security group**. For *Security group name*, enter "ELBSG", and leave the defaults in the table below. Click **Next: Configure Routing**.

In the *Target group* section, select **New target group**. Give it a *Name* of "ELBTG", and leave the default settings for *Target type* (Instance), *Protocol* (HTTP), and *Port* (80). Leave the *Health checks* settings as they are. In the *Advanced health checks settings* section, leave everything as it is, but change the value for *Healthy threshold* to **2** (instead of the default *5*). This will speed things up when we're running health checks for our Application Load Balancer. Click **Next: Register Targets**.

In the *Instances* section, check the box next to both of our EC2 instances. Then, click **Add to registered** above the instances table, which will move our EC2 instances to the *Registered targets* section above. Make sure they show up there before clicking **Next: Review**.

Everything should be good on the *Review* page, so click **Create**. Then click **Close**.

On the load balancer screen, under *Description* at the bottom, we should see a DNS name for our Application Load Balancer. Copy and paste it into a new browser tab, where we'll see we currently can't reach it. This is because our Application Load Balancer is still in the *provisioning* state.

In the meantime, head back to the EC2 console, and click **Instances** in the sidebar (under *INSTANCES*), and let's check that both of our instances are *running*. Copy the IP address of each instance, and paste them both into new browser tabs. Both should properly serve web traffic over port 80 in our browser, displaying the *Amazon Linux AMI Test Page*.

When our Application Load Balancer is finally finished provisioning, it should display a state of *active*. It might take a few minutes. If it doesn't show that state, refresh it to see if it just hasn't updated yet. Once it's *active*, go back to the browser tab with its DNS name, and refresh it to make sure it displays the same *Amazon Linux AMI Test Page*.

Now that this is all set up and properly configured, we're ready to use our Application Load Balancer and our instances' IP addresses for the next step.

## Configuring Route 53 DNS Record Sets

We now want to set up the Route 53 DNS record sets to point to the Application Load Balancer whenever a user navigates to a custom domain name in their browser. Our Application Load Balancer currently has a not-so-pretty domain name, and we want to set up a custom domain name we can send users to so they can interact with our application. Now, let's see how we can do this with Route 53.

Back in the AWS console, navigate to **Route 53** via **Services** (under *Networking & Content Delivery*).

A custom domain name has already been registered for you, so you don't need to worry about registering one here.

When we're working with Route 53, the first thing we need to deal with is hosted zones. Click **Hosted zones**, where we'll see a domain name listed — it should be something along the lines of *cmcloudlab990.info*. Click the domain name, and let's take a look.

We'll see we have two record sets: one with a *Type* of *NS* (which stands for "name server") and one with a *Type* of *SOA* (which stands for "start of authority"). These are the only ones we need — if you see more than two, like *NA*, you can delete them. We just need *NS* and *SOA*.

Copy the domain name of the *NS* type, and paste it into a new browser tab. We should see it can't currently be reached. So if a user were to try and access this URL, it wouldn't be found. We need to configure it so that when someone navigates to this domain name in a browser, the user is redirected to the Application Load Balancer's IP address or the IP addresses of the EC2 instances that are serving our application.

Here's a quick sidetrack to talk about how that works.

#### What Happens When We Access a Custom Domain Name

When we paste this custom domain name into the browser, our browser is going to check to see if it has the IP address cached in the browser or if it's cached at the operating system level. In this case, it doesn't, so it will go over to the ISP we're using and check if the ISP's DNS resolver has information about where to go for the domain name. The ISP's DNS resolver will have a bunch of caching in place, so it will likely know both the location of the website and the locations of name servers, such as the .com top-level domain name server.

If we navigate to a certain domain name, but don't know where it is, we'll ask the ISP's DNS resolver. If it doesn't know, it will ask the root name server where to go. If *it* doesn't know, it will then move on to the .com name server, which is another server that has more information about the .com top-level domain. If *that one* doesn't know, it will move the process to the ISP's DNS resolver yet again. Once it has the name servers, it knows where to go to look for more information about the site, and the ISP's DNS resolver will ask Route 53 if it knows where to find the site. Route 53 is the service we're using to have the name servers in the background tell us where to find the website we want to find at the web address.

We're going to do a few things to make Route 53 always point to the correct IP address. Before we work on that part of the lab, let's dig a bit more into this process.

#### The Command Line Tool `dig`

We're going to do a little more research using the command line tool `dig`, which allows us to run the process we just discussed without the need for a web browser.

Note: In the video, Fernando used dig installed on his local PC. In a terminal (assuminig dig is installed), run:

```
dig www.linuxacademy.com
```

We'll see some information about some of the hops we're going through when we're looking for the particular place to find *www.linuxacademy.com*. Essentially, the question we asked `dig` was, where can we find *www.linuxacademy.com*? It's going to give us some answers, including the IP addresses that currently host the website. If we copy one of these IP addresses and paste it into a new browser tab, we'll land on *www.linuxacademy.com* — it will essentially redirect and show the domain name in the window.

It will also give us information about the name servers for the domain, as well as information about the particular name servers and other information for the IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. We're not going to get too deep into this, but it's good to know we can use this.

If we wanted more detailed information, we could enter:

```
dig www.linuxacademy.com +trace
```

This would essentially go through all the hops, so we'll see all the root servers, top-level domain servers, and name servers, which finally say where we can find the IP addresses for the domain name we're looking for.

Let's continue with the lab and head back to Route 53 in the AWS console.

### Create the Record Sets

What do we need to do to make this process happen for our own custom domain name in Route 53?

We need to add a few records to the record sets for this domain. The records will tell Route 53 where to look for the physical machine that's hosting our service to send traffic to that machine.

Click **Create Record Set**. For *Type*, set it to **A – IPv4 address**.

We could use an alias, or we could choose not to use an alias. Aliases allow us to point to particular things, like Application Load Balancers or Classic Load Balancers as well as S3 static websites. The reason we have these inside AWS is because the actual IP address for these different services may change. Behind the scenes, AWS has a bunch of different web servers that, on any given day, might be hosting this different information. These servers may be switching IP addresses around. So if we choose a target alias for the Application Load Balancer, whenever the record set is asked for the record for this particular non-www domain, it's going to check the actual domain that's currently set up for this Application Load Balancer and then check the IP address currently set up for the domain. It will then route us there instead of a static IP address.

Set *Alias* to **Yes**. For the *Alias Target*, set it to the **ELB** listed under *ELB Application load balancers*. Click **Create**. We should now see a new record set listed with a *Type* of *A*.

Click **Create Record Set** again. This time, type "www" in the *Name* box. Leave *Type* set to **A – IPv4 address**. Then, set *Alias* to **Yes**, and select the **ELB** again for *Alias Target*. Click **Create**. Now, we should have two A records, one for each version of our domain (both the non-www and the www).

Now, go back to the browser tab with our domain and try refreshing it again. It should still prevent us from going to the domain because the information in our record sets has to get sent out to the name servers, so it needs a little while to propagate. Wait a few minutes and then refresh.

> **Note:** They could take up to 15 minutes to finally show up, so don't panic if they take longer than you expect. The www and non-www versions might even take different amounts of time to properly load when you try to access the URLs. You could even use `dig` to check the records and see if they are in yet.

Once some time has passed, refresh it again, and we should finally be able to navigate to the *Amazon Linux AMI Test Page* from our custom domain.

## Conclusion

Congratulations on completing this lab! We've now successfully used Route 53 to create DNS record sets that point to an Application Load Balancer, which is then routing traffic between multiple EC2 instances. This allows us to have a custom domain name and a highly available, scalable load balancer application.
