# Building a Three Tier Network VPC From Scratch in AWS

In this lab, we're going to create a three-tier VPC network from scratch. We'll start by building the VPC, building and attaching an internet gateway, and building six different subnets inside our VPC:

- A DMZ layer
- An app layer
- A database layer

Next, we're going to split these pairs of subnets across two different Availability Zones — the bare minimum we always want to do for highly available and fault-tolerant architecture in AWS.

Then we're going to create two different route tables:

- A route to the internet for our public subnets, or subnets we want to have access to the open internet
- A route to the NAT gateway so that anything placed into our private subnets will have a route to update software from the open internet

Finally, we'll add some security to our subnets with three network access control lists (NACLs), which we'll assign to our pairs of subnet layers.

If you haven't already done so, log in to the environment using the credentials provided on the lab page. The username will always be `cloud_user`, and the password will be provided next to the `cloud_user` login name. Select **Sign In**. Once you're in the AWS account, make sure you are using `us-east-1` (N. Virginia) as the selected region.

## Build and Configure a VPC, Subnets, and Internet Gateway

Let's begin by creating the foundation of our VPC. We'll start by creating our VPC, creating six subnets inside the VPC, and creating and attaching an internet gateway to our VPC.

Select **All services**, and then click **VPC** under *Networking & Content Delivery*.

On the *Resources* page, we'll see there aren't currently any VPCs created.

- Click **Your VPCs** in the sidebar.
- Click **Create VPC**.
- For the *Name tag*, enter "SysOpsVPC".
- For the *IPv4 CIDR block* range, enter "10.99.0.0/16".
- Leave the *IPv6 CIDR block* and *Tenancy* fields as their default values.
- Click **Create**.

We've now created our VPC, but we still need to create the components within the VPC. Close out of the success message.

We have six subnets to create — two each for the DMZ, app, and database layers.

Let's start with the DMZ layer.

- Click **Subnets** in the sidebar.
- Click **Create subnet**.
- For the *Name tag*, enter "DMZ1public".
- Select **SysOpsVPC** in the *VPC* dropdown menu.
- Select **us-east-1a** in the *Availability Zone* dropdown menu.
- For the *IPv4 CIDR block* range, enter "10.99.1.0/24".
- Click **Create**, and close out of the success message.

- Click **Create subnet**.
- For the *Name tag*, enter "DMZ2public".
- Set the *VPC* to **SysOpsVPC**.
- Set the *Availability Zone* to **us-east-1b**.
- For the *IPv4 CIDR block* range, enter "10.99.2.0/24".
- Click **Create**, and close out of the success message.

Next, let's make the app layers.

- Click **Create subnet**.
- For the *Name tag*, enter "AppLayer1private".
- Set the *VPC* to **SysOpsVPC**.
- Set the *Availability Zone* to **us-east-1a**.
- For the *IPv4 CIDR block* range, enter "10.99.11.0/24".
- Click **Create**, and close out of the success message.

- Click **Create subnet**.
- For the *Name tag*, enter "AppLayer2private".
- Set the *VPC* to **SysOpsVPC**.
- Set the *Availability Zone* to **us-east-1b**.
- For the *IPv4 CIDR block* range, enter "10.99.12.0/24".
- Click **Create**, and close out of the success message.

Finally, let's create our database layers.

- Click **Create subnet**.
- For the *Name tag*, enter "DBLayer1private".
- Set the *VPC* to **SysOpsVPC**.
- Set the *Availability Zone* to **us-east-1a**.
- For the *IPv4 CIDR block* range, enter "10.99.21.0/24".
- Click **Create**, and close out of the success message.

- Click **Create subnet**.
- For the *Name tag*, enter "DBLayer2private".
- Set the *VPC* to **SysOpsVPC**.
- Set the *Availability Zone* to **us-east-1b**.
- For the *IPv4 CIDR block* range, enter "10.99.22.0/24".
- Click **Create**, and close out of the success message.

We've now created all six subnets. We have three subnets each in the `us-east-1a` Availability Zone and the `us-east-1b` Availability Zone.

Notice a pattern in the CIDR block ranges? Using the third octet, we categorized them by groups of 10. So for quick reference, we know that if the third octet is:

- 1 or 2, it's part of the DMZ layer
- In the teens, it's part of the app layer
- In the 20s, it's part of the database layer

*Note:* Whether we labeled these subnets public or private doesn’t *actually* make them public or private — it’s just a naming construct. We’ll actually make them public or private in a bit when we route them to a public or private route table.

Now, we need to create the internet gateway.

- Click **Internet Gateways** in the sidebar.
- Click **Create internet gateway**.
- For the *Name tag*, enter "IGW".
- Click **Create**, and close out of the success message.

Once it's created, you'll see its *State* says *detached*. Even though it's been created, it isn't part of the VPC yet. Let's fix that.

- Click **Actions** at the top of the screen.
- Click **Attach to VPC**.
- Set the *VPC* to **SysOpsVPC**.
- Click **Attach**.

The state should now say *attached*.

## Build and Configure a NAT Gateway, Route Tables, and NACLs

Next, we need to create a NAT gateway and route tables, set up proper routing, and create and associate our NACLs.

First, let's create our NAT gateway.

- Click **NAT Gateways** in the sidebar.
  - If there’s one already in your account, you can ignore it; we’re still going to create a new one.
- Click **Create NAT Gateway**.
- Set the *Subnet* to **DMZ2public**.

All NAT gateways require that we create and attach an elastic IP address. We could attach our own if we previously created one, but let's have AWS do it for us. Click **Create New EIP**, and then close out of the success message.

Next, we need to create our route tables. (We can do this while the status of our NAT gateway is pending, since it'll take a few minutes.)

Click **Route Tables** in the sidebar. We can see that a route table already exists — when we created the VPC, it created a default route table. But we're going to create two new route tables.

- Click **Create route table**.
- For the *Name tag*, enter "PublicRT".
- Set the *VPC* to **SysOpsVPC**.
- Click **Create**, and close out of the success message.

- Click **Create route table**.
- For the *Name tag*, enter "PrivateRT".
- Set the *VPC* to **SysOpsVPC**.
- Click **Create**, and close out of the success message.

On their own, route tables don't do anything — we have to give them routes *to* something. For the public route table, we need to provide a route to the internet gateway. For the private route table, we need to provide a route to the NAT gateway.

Navigate to the bottom of the screen, where you'll find the **Summary** and **Routes** tabs. Select **PublicRT** at the top, and click the **Routes** tab at the bottom.

Under *Target*, it says *local*, which means it can communicate with any of the subnets that are in the VPC. However, right now, nothing can communicate with the internet gateway, so nothing can communicate with the outside internet. Let's fix that.

- Click **Edit routes**.
- Click **Add route**.
- Click into the *Target* field, and select **Internet Gateway** from the dropdown menu.
- Enter "0.0.0.0/0" in the *Destination* field.
- Click **Save routes**, and close out of the success message.

We've now created a route from our public route table through the internet gateway into the open internet. Close out of the success message.

Now let's go to the private route table. Here, we need to add a route from the private route table to the NAT gateway.

- Select **PrivateRT** at the top of the screen.
- Under the **Routes** tab at the bottom of the screen, click **Edit routes**.
- Click **Add route**.
- Click into the *Target* field, and select **NAT Gateway** from the dropdown menu.
- Enter "0.0.0.0/0" in the *Destination* field.
- Click **Save routes**, and close out of the success message.

Although both of these route tables have been created, they aren't currently associated with any subnets. This is another important part of routing: We have to associate subnets with a route table in order for those subnets — or the resources provisioned inside those subnets — to be able to access them.

Now, we're going to make our public subnets, well, *public*. They're currently only labeled as public, but by associating them with a route table that has a path to the internet gateway, we're going to make them public for real.

- At the top of the screen, click **PublicRT**.
- Under **Subnet Associations** at the bottom of the screen, click **Edit subnet associations**.
- Select the **DMZ1public** and **DMZ2public** subnets.
- Click **Save**.

Next, let's associate our private subnets with the private route table.

- Select **PrivateRT** at the top of the screen.
- Under **Subnet Associations** at the bottom of the screen, click **Edit subnet associations**.
- Select the four private subnets.
- Click **Save**.

Now anything placed inside the public route table has a route to the internet gateway, and anything placed inside the private route table has a route to the NAT gateway.

If we have databases or EC2 instances located inside these private subnets, they can get updates from the open internet by going through the NAT gateway, which provides an extra layer of security. Essentially, it’s a one-way street: The resources in the private subnets can access the open internet, but the open internet cannot access the resources in the private subnets (unless we explicitly allow it).

We’re almost done with this lab. Before we wrap things up, let’s add another layer of security to our VPC by creating an NACL — a sort of firewall for controlling traffic in and out of one or more subnets — for each of our layers.

Click **Network ACLs** in the sidebar. We should see a default NACL, like we saw with the route tables. The default NACL was created when we created our VPC. But we're going to create three new ones.

- Click **Create network ACL** at the top of the screen.
- For the *Name tag*, enter "DMZNACL".
- Set the *VPC* to **SysOpsVPC**.
- Click **Create**.

- Click **Create network ACL** at the top of the screen.
- For the *Name tag*, enter "AppNACL".
- Set the *VPC* to **SysOpsVPC**.
- Click **Create**.

- Click **Create network ACL** at the top of the screen.
- For the *Name tag*, enter "DBNACL".
- Set the *VPC* to **SysOpsVPC**.
- Click **Create**.

Just like with the route tables, we need to associate subnets with our NACLs.

- Select **DMZNACL** at the top of the screen.
- At the bottom of the screen, click **Subnet associations**.
- Click **Edit subnet associations**.
- Select the DMZ layer subnets.
- Click **Edit**.

Now traffic coming in and out of these subnets will be subject to the inbound and outbound rules we set up on this particular NACL. We're not going to set up any rules as part of this lab — right now, we're just building the infrastructure and a shell we could put resources in.

Let's finish things up with the NACLs for the remaining layers.

- Select **AppNACL** at the top of the screen.
- Under **Subnet associations** at the bottom of the screen, click **Edit subnet associations**.
- Select the app layer subnets.
- Click **Edit**.

- Select **DBNACL** at the top of the screen.
- Under **Subnet associations** at the bottom of the screen, click **Edit subnet associations**.
- Select the database layer subnets.
- Click **Edit**.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've just built a three-tier VPC networking architecture inside AWS.

The bare-bones architecture we built in this lab is a design you're going to see a lot when working in AWS. Now, go keep learning!
