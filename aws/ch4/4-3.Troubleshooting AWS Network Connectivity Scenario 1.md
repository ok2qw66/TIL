# Troubleshooting AWS Network Connectivity: Scenario 1

Welcome aboard! There's no time to waste in this lab. We've got an NACL instance (`Instance3`) that won't connect to the internet, and we need it to. But we don't even know yet what's wrong with it, so a bit of troubleshooting is in order before we can get to fixing the problem.

## Prerequisites

We need to make sure we are in the `us-east-1` region, and we've got to use the login credentials provided on the hands-on lab page.

We're going to start by looking at `Instance3`. Think of it as the center of an onion. Once we're done there, we'll work our way out through the other layers of AWS services and products until we've figured out what's broken.

## Troubleshooting the instance itself

Let's get into EC2 from the AWS dashboard, and look at the details of `Instance3`. Once we're in there looking, we'll notice that it's only got a private IP address. It needs a public IP address, so we've got to assign one.

Checkmark Instance 3. Up in the **Actions** menu, go to **Networking** > **Manage IP Addresses**. In this pop-up window, we can click on **Assign new IP**, but that's going to give it another *private* IP address.

Click the allocate link and allocate an Elastic IP. Click Allocate Elastic IP address. Choose Allocate. Choose Actions, Associate Elastic IP address. Then click choose Instance 3 and click Associate.

Now if we look at the EC2 instance details, we'll see it's got a public IP. But if we ping that public IP from a terminal, none of our packets are going through. Something is still discombobulated. Since we know the instance itself is fine though, let's leave `ping` command running in this terminal, then step out a little and look at the next onion layer.

## Security Groups

In the `Instance3` details, we can see that it's associated with a security group that has `EC2SecurityGroup3` in its name. Let's navigate to *Security Groups* in the left-hand menu and find the one named something like `EC2SecurityGroup3`. Highlight it so that the details show up on the bottom of the screen. In the *Inbound* tab, we can see that SSH and ICMP (ping) traffic is allowed. In the *Outbound* tab, *all* traffic is allowed. This means that our Security Group rule is fine, and isn't what broke our `Instance3` connection to the internet.

Let's move out to the next onion layer. Be careful though. We don't want to create those tear-inducing vapors we get with real onions...

## Subnet Configuration

Moving along, let's take a peek at how we've got this instance's subnet configured. Back on the screen showing our instances, we can see that `Instance3` has a private IP. We actually saw this before, remember?

In a new browser tab, let's head over to the VPC Dashboard, and get into our subnets. Look for the one that `Instance3` is in. For instance, if the private IP of `Instance3` is 10.3.1.49, then we're going to click on the subnet with a CIDR of 10.3.1.0/24. Let's say that this is called `PublicSubnet4`, just so we have a name we can refer back to.

Once we click on that subnet, its details show up down in the lower part of the screen.

## NACL

In that section of the subnet page (in the *Description* tab) we can see the NACL this is assigned to. Let's click on that and have a gander at the rules.

The *Inbound* tab, once we get in will show... *Whoah!* That's a problem. All inbound traffic is set to **DENY**. We see the same thing in the Outbound tab. This means that the NACL is blocking *all* traffic in and out of the instance, despite what the security group says.

We've got a few options here. We can edit this NACL to allow the traffic, make a *new* NACL, or kick this subnet over so that it uses a different NACL (one with the rules we want already set up) altogether. In a production environment, we'd probably want to go with the first or second option. Here in this lab though, just to get things up and running quicker, we're going with Plan C, swapping the subnet over to an existing NACL.

- 해결방법

  - 1.  edit this NACL to allow the traffic => 인바운드 규칙 수정하기

    2.  make a *new* NACL => 새로운 NACL 만들기

    3. kick this subnet over so that it uses a different NACL (one with the rules we want already set up)  

       => 이전에 만들어놓은 NACL 중에서 가상 유사한 것으로 대체하기

- 운영상황에서는 1,2번을 적용하지만 여기서는 3번으로 해결해보겠다

If we look through the others, we'll find one that allows SSH, All ICMP (ping), and ephemeral ports. The outbound rules are pretty much the same (except that they block SSH), and this is close enough for what we want. Remember the name (like, `Public-3-NACL`) and head back into where we can edit the `PublicSubnet4` subnet's properties.

In the *Network ACL* tab (in the lower half of the screen), click on the **Edit network ACL association** button. There's a *Change to **dropdown here. Find and select `Public-3-NACL` in the list, click the blue** Save **button, then click the blue** Close** button.

- `Public-3-NACL`의 inbound,outbound 규칙이 ssh,ping 포트 허가하고 있는데 우리가 열어줄 포트랑 동일하다 ==> 서브넷 10.3.1.0/24에 연결될 NACL을 바꿔서 연결하자!

This should be working now. Let's peek at the ping command we left running in that terminal earlier.

This is terrible. We're not done yet. Our pings are still timing out.

Well, we've still got a couple other layers of the onion we can look at...

## Route Table

We should still have the subnet window open for `PublicSubnet4`. Let's get into the *Route Table* tab and see what's shaking there.

Aha! Another problem has reared its ugly head. We've got a route table that doesn't allow any traffic to the internet. We've got to either add a route to this table, or add a different route table that has the appropriate paths specified in it.

In the real world, editing this route table may have some far-reaching repercussions. What if there's another instance using it that we *don't* want having internet access? Let's not edit this one. We'll go looking for for one that works already.

Click on **Edit route table association**, then find one with access to the public. Something like `Public3-RT`. We'll see, once we select it, whether or not it's routing to the public *and* our private subnet. Click on the blue **Save** button once we've got the right route table selected, then the blue **Close** button.

Take a quick peek back at the pinging terminal. What do we see? ***Responses!\*** Kill the `ping` command, and try SSH with the lab's username and password. ***Success!\***

## Conclusion

We did it! This EC2 instance couldn't find the internet, even if it had GPS and a copilot, until we figured out what ailed it and fixed the various connectivity obstacles. This is the kind of thing AWS admins run into a lot out in the wild, and learning how to troubleshoot problems is a big step along the way to a certification. Congratulations!
