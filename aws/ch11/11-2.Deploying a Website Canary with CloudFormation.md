## Introduction

In this lab, we'll use AWS CloudFormation to deploy our own website Canary application.

Log in to the AWS console with the `cloud_user` credentials provided on the lab page, and make sure you are in `us-east-1` throughout the lab.

Once you're logged in, navigate to S3. Then, open CloudFormation in a new browser tab. We'll leave both tabs open as we work with them throughout the lab.

## Upload a Lambda Function Zip File Deployment Artifact to S3

First, we're going to upload a deployment zip package to S3 inside the AWS console so our CloudFormation template can rely on it during the creation process.

1. Navigate to S3.
2. Click **+ Create bucket**.
3. On the *Name and region* screen, give your bucket a globally unique name — in addition to "website-canary-2018-cf-test", you could append your name, favorite animal, and some random letters. Copy the bucket name into a note or text file on your desktop — we'll need it again later. Click **Next**.
4. Click **Next** two more times, leaving the default settings on the subsequent screens, and finally click **Create bucket**.
5. Click into the bucket, and click **Upload**.
6. Upload the `canary.zip` file from the GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/linuxacademy/aws-cda-2018/blob/master/cloudformation/lab-files/canary.zip) into the S3 bucket.

## Create a CloudFormation Stack

Now, we'll create a CloudFormation stack in the AWS console using the designer and the code samples provided.

1. Head to the CloudFormation browser tab.

2. Click **Create Stack**, and then click **Design template**.

3. Select the *Template* tab of the editor.

4. Paste in the code from the sample `cftemplate.json` file [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linuxacademy/aws-cda-2018/master/cloudformation/lab-files/cftemplate.json).

5. In the `Code` section of the template, enter the name of your bucket where it says `"S3Bucket": "REPLACEME"`.

6. In the

    

   ```
   Properties
   ```

    

   portion of the

    

   ```
   LambdaCanaryFunction
   ```

    

   section of the template:

   - Update the `site` with the name of the website you'd like to check (including `https://`)
   - Update `expected` with some text you might expect to see on that site.
   - Update `phone` with the phone number at which you want to receive a text notification (including `+` and your country code — e.g., `1` for the United States).

7. Click the checkbox icon in the top left to validate the template.

8. Click the upload icon in the top left to create the stack.

9. This brings us back to the *Create stack* page we saw in the beginning, but now our Amazon S3 template URL is auto-filled. Click **Next**.

10. Give the stack a name (e.g., "cf-test-2018-canary"), and click **Next**.

11. We don't need to do any configuration on the *Options* page, so click **Next**.

12. On the *Review* page, check the box to acknowledge AWS CloudFormation might create IAM resources, and click **Create**.

13. If you don't see the stack listed yet, click the refresh icon. It should then show the creation is in progress.

### Test the Lambda Function

1. Navigate to Lambda via the *Services* menu at the top.
2. Click into the listed Lambda function.
3. Click the *Select a test event* dropdown at the top, and select **Configure test events**.
4. In the *Event template* dropdown, search for "Amazon CloudWatch".
5. Give it an *Event name* of "test".
6. Click **Create**.
7. Click **Test** at the top. You should receive a text message letting you know the check passed.

## Conclusion

Congratulations on completing this lab!
