# Creating a Basic Amazon S3 Lifecycle Policy

## Introduction

AWS Glacier is a long-term archive storage service that provides lower-cost storage than other AWS storage options. When data has not been accessed for a certain period of time, it can be moved automatically between S3 storage classes using a lifecycle policy. In this lab, we will create a basic Amazon S3 lifecycle policy.

## Solution

Log in to the AWS Management Console using the credentials provided on the lab instructions page. Make sure you're using the `us-east-1` region.

Feel free to [download the *pinehead.jpg* file](https://github.com/tia-la/ccp) if you'd like to upload it to the folder we'll create.

### Create an S3 Bucket and Upload an Object

1. Navigate to S3.
2. Click **Create bucket**.
3. For *Bucket name*, type "lalifecycle". (Since bucket names must be globally unique, add a series of random numbers at the end.)
4. Un-check *Block all public access*.
5. Check to acknowledge that the current settings might result in the bucket and the objects within it becoming public.
6. Click **Create bucket**.
7. Click the name of the bucket to open it, and then click **+ Create folder**.
8. Name the folder "MyProject", and click **Save**.
9. Open the folder, and click **Upload**.
10. Upload any file you'd like (which could be the *pinehead.jpg* file if you downloaded that from GitHub).
11. Click **Next**.
12. Under *Manage public permissions*, select **Grant public read access to this object(s)**.
13. Click **Next** > **Next** > **Upload**.

### Create a Lifecycle Policy

1. Click the bucket name at the top of the page.
2. Select the **Management** tab.
3. Click **+ Add lifecycle rule**.
4. Name the rule "s3toGlacier".
5. Under *Choose a rule scope*, select **Apply to all objects in the bucket**.
6. Click **Next**.
7. On the *Storage class transition* screen, check the boxes next to **Current version** and **Previous versions**.
8. Next to For current versions of objects, click + Add transition, and set the following values:
   - *Object creation*: **Transition to Glacier after**
   - *Days after creation*: **30** days
9. Check to acknowledge that this lifecycle rule will increase the one-time lifecycle request cost if it transitions small objects.
   - 작은객체를 전환하면 수명주기 규칙으로 인해 수명주기요청비용이 증가할 수 있다.
10. Next to For previous versions of objects, click \+ Add transition, and set the following values:
    - *Object becomes a previous version*: **Transition to Glacier Deep Archive after**
    - *Days after objects become noncurrent*: **15** days
11. Check to acknowledge that this lifecycle rule will increase the one-time lifecycle request cost if it transitions small objects.
    - 작은 객체를 전환하면 이 수명 주기 규칙으로 인해 일회성 수명 주기 요청 비용이 증가한다는 점을 이해합니다.
12. Click **Next**.
13. On the *Configure expiration* screen, check **Previous versions**.
14. With **Permanently delete previous versions** checked, type "365" in to indicate they should delete after 365 days from becoming a previous version.
    - 365일 이후에는 영구삭제한다
15. Click **Next**.
16. Check the box to acknowledge the lifecycle rule will apply to all objects in the bucket.
17. Click **Save**.

- 접근 안 한지 30일이 지나면 Bucker에서 Glacier로 옮긴다
- Glacier에 들어가고 접근 안 한지 15일이 지나면 Glacier Deep Archive로 옮긴다
- Glacier Deep Archive 이후 접근 안 한지 365일이 지나면 영구삭제한다

### 접근 통제 3단계

1. 식별(Identification) => 누가 왔는지 확인하는 것
2. 인증(Authentication) 
   - 지식 : password
   - 소유 : OTP, 스마트폰, 공인인증서   ==> 추측불가, 검증추가장비가 필요
   - 특징 : 성문, 지문, 정맥, 홍채, 필기체 서명
3. 인가(Authorization)  =>  권한을 부여하는 것
   - 화면
   - 기능
   - 데이터
