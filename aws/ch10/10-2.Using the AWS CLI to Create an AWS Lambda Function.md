# Using the AWS CLI to Create an AWS Lambda Function

## Introduction

This hands-on lab provides experience with creating and customizing Lambda functions, all from within the CLI. The primary focus will be on Lambda, AWS CLI, and CloudWatch log streams. AWS Lambda allows you to create functions and only have to worry about managing your code. Using the CLI allows you to "ditch the clicks" — all those mouse gestures required when you create a function within the console.

## Solution

Log in to the live AWS environment using the credentials provided. Make sure you're in the N. Virginia (`us-east-1`) region throughout the lab.

All code used in the lesson is available to [download on GitHub](https://github.com/linuxacademy/content-lambda-deep-dive/tree/master/section_4/live_activity_5). You do not need to rewrite it.

### Verify Lab Resources and Configure AWS CLI

1. Navigate to S3, and verify at least two buckets are listed.

2. Navigate to **IAM** > **Roles**.

3. Click the listed **lambda_exec_role_LA**.

4. Copy its *Role ARN* and paste it into a text file, as we'll need this later in the lab.

   arn:aws:iam::233489832487:role/lambda_exec_role_LA

5. Navigate to **EC2** > **Instances**.

6. Verify that the listed instance's public IP matches the public IP of the public instance provided on the lab page.

7. Open a terminal session.

8. Log in to the provided instance via SSH:

   ```bash
   ssh cloud_user@<PUBLIC IP>
   ```

9. Make sure the AWS CLI works:

   ```bash
   aws help
   ```

   We should then see a man page, which means the AWS CLI is installed.

10. Exit out of it by entering `q`.

11. View the Lambda-specific man pages:

    ```bash
    aws lambda help
    ```

12. Exit out of it by entering `q`.

13. List all Lambda functions in the region:

    ```bash
    aws lambda list-functions --region us-east-1
    ```

    We should see an empty list.

### Create a Lambda Function Using the AWS CLI

1. Create the file:

   ```bash
   vim lambda_function.js
   ```

2. Enter the following (also found in the `lambda_function.js` file [on GitHub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linuxacademy/content-lambda-deep-dive/master/section_4/live_activity_5/lambda_function.js)):

   ```
   // Here is where we load the SDK for JavaScript
   const AWS = require('aws-sdk');
   
   // We need to set the region.
   AWS.config.update({region: 'us-east-1'});
   
   // Creating S3 service object
   const s3 = new AWS.S3({apiVersion: '2006-03-01'});
   
   exports.handler = (event, context, callback) => {
       // Here we list all S3 Buckets
       s3.listBuckets(function(err, data) {
          if (err) {
             console.log("Error:", err);
          } else {
             console.log("List of all S3 Buckets", data.Buckets);
          }
       });
   };
   ```

3. Write and quit the file.

4. Verify it's there:

   ```bash
   ls
   ```

5. Zip the file:

   ```bash
   zip lambda_function.zip lambda_function.js
   ```

6. Verify they both exist:

   ```bash
   ll
   ```

7. Create the Lambda function (replacing `<ROLE ARN>` with the IAM role ARN you copied in the AWS console earlier):

   ```bash
   aws lambda create-function \
   --region us-east-1 \
   --function-name "ListS3Buckets" \
   --runtime "nodejs12.x" \
   --role "<ROLE ARN>" \
   --handler "lambda_function.handler" \
   --zip-file fileb:///home/cloud_user/lambda_function.zip
   ```

   ```
   {
       "TracingConfig": {
           "Mode": "PassThrough"
       },
       "CodeSha256": "RMLkjzLfxjNDWwdI8qN2cECPkO1ieu3D7uyUx2LXnM0=",
       "FunctionName": "ListS3Buckets",
       "CodeSize": 482,
       "RevisionId": "dfdcaf0b-0d9b-4589-883d-52e8ff4c388a",
       "MemorySize": 128,
       "FunctionArn": "arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:233489832487:function:ListS3Buckets",
       "Version": "$LATEST",
       "Role": "arn:aws:iam::233489832487:role/lambda_exec_role_LA",
       "Timeout": 3,
       "LastModified": "2020-10-13T06:28:59.081+0000",
       "Handler": "lambda_function.handler",
       "Runtime": "nodejs12.x",
       "Description": ""
   }
   ```

   

8. In the AWS console, navigate to **Lambda** > **Functions**. We should see the *ListS3Buckets* function we just created. Note its current description.

9. Back in the terminal, update the function:

   ```bash
   aws lambda update-function-configuration \
   --region us-east-1 \
   --function-name "ListS3Buckets" \
   --description "Creating our S3 function via CLI." \
   --timeout 5 \
   --memory-size 256
   ```

10. In the AWS console, refresh the Lambda functions page. We should see an updated description.

    ```
    {
        "TracingConfig": {
            "Mode": "PassThrough"
        },
        "CodeSha256": "RMLkjzLfxjNDWwdI8qN2cECPkO1ieu3D7uyUx2LXnM0=",
        "FunctionName": "ListS3Buckets",
        "CodeSize": 482,
        "RevisionId": "25e02457-412f-412f-b31c-86fb53b45943",
        "MemorySize": 256,
        "FunctionArn": "arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:233489832487:function:ListS3Buckets",
        "Version": "$LATEST",
        "Role": "arn:aws:iam::233489832487:role/lambda_exec_role_LA",
        "Timeout": 5,
        "LastModified": "2020-10-13T06:29:43.393+0000",
        "Handler": "lambda_function.handler",
        "Runtime": "nodejs12.x",
        "Description": "Creating our S3 function via CLI."
    }
    ```

    

11. Click the function to view its code.

12. Scroll to the *Basic settings* section to verify it has 256 MB memory and a five-second timeout.

### Invoke Your Function Using AWS CLI

1. In the terminal, invoke the function:

   ```bash
   aws lambda invoke \
   --region us-east-1 \
   --function-name "ListS3Buckets" OUTFILE.log
   ```

   ```
   {
       "FunctionError": "Unhandled",
       "ExecutedVersion": "$LATEST",
       "StatusCode": 200
   }
   ```

   

2. Back in the AWS console, click the **Monitoring** tab for our function. We should see an invocation.

3. Navigate to **CloudWatch** > **Logs**.

4. Click the listed log group.

5. Click the listed log stream. There, we should see the log activity.

6. Expand the print statement. There, we should see that we're printing "List of all S3 Buckets," followed by our bucket names and their creation dates.

7. In the terminal, check the output of the `OUTFILE.log` file:

   ```
   cat OUTFILE.log
   ```

   We should see `null` since we aren't returning any response object — we're only printing to the CloudWatch logs, which we see in the AWS console.
